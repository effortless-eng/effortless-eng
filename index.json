See the parent page for details. Have you ever had so many views in so many files open that even colorized tabs couldn\u0026rsquo;t help you? (kudos to Ehsan for pyRevit 😉) Unfortunately there is a limit where horizontal lists like the view tabs get unmanageable, and you loose track of what you have open. The other built-in lists which are provided are quite inconvenient, and difficult to overview.\nThen comes View Tracker to save your day!\nThis tool provides an user friendly way of managing your currently or recently open views. Your views will be organized in a simple dockable panel, grouped by their parent file. You are also able to collapse these groups to free up real-estate, and you can close any view or project if you wish to. You closed a view by accident? Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, we got you covered! Just enable Show Recent Views and you can see the views which were open in your current session.\nThis tool can be extremely helpful for BIM Managers, or any powerusers who have to deal with many files and many views simultaneously.\nLayout # In the dockable panel you can see all your currently open views. They are grouped by their parent file, which groups can be collapsed. The views are sorted by their type and by their name. Their type is shown by the little icon on the left, and also in the tooltip, above their view template if there is any. Your active view is shown in bold. Your views will be automatically added once opened.\nFurthermore the actual count of open views will be shown in the group header on the right in the following format: file / total.\nFunctions #Activating a view #Quite straightforward, just double-click on any, even if it is closed already, but still tracked as a recent view.\nCollapse a group #Clicking on any group header will collapse or expand it\u0026rsquo;s content accordingly.\nClosing a view / remove from recents #Middle mouse button clicks will close any open views, can be used to remove any recent views too.\nContext menu #Using the right mouse button you can get the context menu which has the following functions:\nClose View Closes the highlighted view\nClose File Closes the file which contains the highlighted view\nShow Recent Views Toggles the visibility of recent views\nClear Recent Views Removes all recent views from the panel\n","date":null,"permalink":"/revit-addins/views/view-tracker/","section":"Revit Add-Ins","summary":"Keep track of all you recently open views.","title":"View Tracker"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
